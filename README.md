# Simple-Decision-Trees
In this I have build one decision tree regressor model and another decision tree classifier model after preprocessing the data related to movies collection. After that I have plotted the decision tree using pydotplus library and pruned the tree on these three criteria (maximum no. of levels, Minimum observations at internal node and Minimum observations at leaf node)
